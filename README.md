*Notice* This is a side-project related to Minecraft-AI (https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai). Its objective is to offer a more accessible development method for Minecraft AI characters. Currently, it is in the early development phase. As a result, the AI characters in this side-project are not as capable as those in the original Minecraft-AI. If you wish to have the experience of interacting with more intelligent AI characters, we highly recommend using Minecraft-AI.

Minecraft AI-Python is a Python framework for controlling Minecraft bots using various LLMs. It builds upon the excellent foundation laid by the <a href="https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft">MINDcraft</a> project, which offers an efficient system for enabling LLM agents to interact with Minecraft environments using MCP-style command-to-action mappings. Many ideas and design choices from MINDcraft have been incorporated into Minecraft AI-Python. In essence, Minecraft AI-Python can be seen as the Pythonic counterpart to MINDcraft (At lease, we hope so ðŸ˜‰).

ðŸ¦¾ Minecraft AI-Python is under development, more functions are added and optimized. If you have any question, welcome to join the our Discord server for more communications!

# Quick Start ðŸš€
0. You need Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.1 for running Minecraft AI-Python. 
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai-python.git
```
2. Enter the root directory.
```
cd Minecraft AI-Python
```
3. Install the required node modules.
```
npm install 
```
4. To add a patch, you need to at first modify the local files of the module (consider files in `patches` as hints), and run 
```
npx patch-package [package-name]
```
Then when you do `npm install`, the patches will be applied.
5. Create a conda environment with python3.10.
```
conda create -n Minecraft AI-Python python=3.10
```
6. Activate the created conda environment. 
```
conda activate Minecraft AI-Python
```
7. Install the required python pacages. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8. Create a new world of version 1.21.1 of Minecraft Java Edition and open it to LAN at port 55916.
9. Fill in your token for the LLM provider service you want to use in configs.json, and make sure the agents you added use the corresponding provider and the supported models.
10. Start the bots. 
```
python main.py
```
11. You can configure the agent in configs.json, which is the default configuration. You can also specify another configuration file when start main.py. You need to restart main.py with new configuaration, after quit the current process by pressing CTRL-C.
```
python main.py path/to/another/configs
```
