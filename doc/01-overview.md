# Overview of MineMCP

**MineMCP** is an open-source Python framework that enables intelligent control of Minecraft bots using Large Language Models (LLMs). It builds upon and extends the foundational ideas of the [MINDcraft](https://github.com/mindcraft-ai/mindcraft) project, with the aim of making LLM-agent integration with Minecraft more accessible, customizable, and Pythonic.

> _“MineMCP is the bridge between natural language understanding and agent-based interaction in Minecraft environments.”_

## 🔍 What is MineMCP?

MineMCP provides a flexible framework for connecting Minecraft bots with LLMs. It supports command-to-action translation, environment state parsing, and intelligent agent behavior powered by LLM prompts or fine-tuned models. Whether you want to build a helper bot that gathers resources, a survival companion that defends against mobs, or an experimental agent that learns from the world around it—MineMCP is your launchpad.

## ✨ Key Features

- **LLM Integration:** Compatible with various large language models (OpenAI, Claude, local models, etc.).
- **Command-to-Action Mapping:** Leverages a modular, MCP-style mapping system for translating natural language into Minecraft agent actions.
- **Environmental Awareness:** Bots can perceive nearby blocks, entities, threats, and goals—enabling richer reasoning and decision-making.
- **Pythonic Design:** Easily extensible and customizable in pure Python.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Capture and feed live game state back into the LLM for dynamic behavior adjustment.
- **Multi-agent Possibilities:** Supports experimentation with multiple bots, inter-agent communication, or LLM-to-LLM dialogue.

## 🧠 Why MineMCP?

The long-term goal of MineMCP is to serve as a testing ground for research in embodied intelligence, real-time decision-making, and memory-enabled agents. It aligns closely with larger research initiatives such as your **Centaurus** project and can act as a frontend testbed for intelligent agents under physically grounded constraints.

MineMCP is not only a development tool but also an educational sandbox—perfect for:
- AI agent prototyping
- Human-AI collaboration experiments
- Reinforcement learning
- Prompt engineering
- Memory-based LLM architectures

需要我接着帮你写「Getting Started」或 API 结构部分吗？也可以加点你在测试过程中实现的任务用例，比如“gathering wood and returning to player”等内容。
